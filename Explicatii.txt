Certainly! Let's go through each function in the provided script and explain its purpose:

1. **`gaussian_with_nan(U, sigma=7)`**:
   - This function computes the Gaussian blur of a NumPy array `U` while handling NaN (Not a Number) values.
   - It uses the `gaussian_filter` function from `scipy.ndimage.filters` to perform the blur.
   - The parameter `sigma` is the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel and is set to a default value of 7.

2. **`print_sdr_config(sdr)`**:
   - This function prints the configuration details of an RTL-SDR device.
   - It outputs information such as the device's serial addresses, whether the device is open, center frequency, sample rate, gain, and available gains.

3. **`get_RMS_power(sdr)`**:
   - Measures the Root Mean Square (RMS) power using an RTL-SDR device.
   - It reads a block of samples, computes the Power Spectral Density (PSD) using Welch's method, and returns the RMS power in dBm.

4. **`export_to_csv(measurements, filename='rms_power_measurements.csv')`**:
   - Exports a list of measurements to a CSV file.
   - The CSV file includes columns for frame number, RMS power (in dBm), X-coordinate, and Y-coordinate.

5. **`visualize_power(measurements)`**:
   - Creates a simple line plot using Matplotlib to visualize the RMS power over time (frame number).

6. **`main()`**:
   - The main entry point of the script.
   - Configures and initializes the RTL-SDR device and the webcam.
   - Sets up variables for storing EMI map, frames, and measurements.
   - Utilizes OpenCV for video processing, including background subtraction, thresholding, and object tracking.
   - Allows user interactions such as selecting a region for tracking, resetting, and displaying the EMI map.
   - Handles the main loop for real-time video processing and user input.
   - Gracefully closes resources (SDR, webcam, and OpenCV) when the script exits.

7. **`__name__ == "__main__"`**:
   - Ensures that the `main()` function is only executed when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

These functions collectively provide a framework for capturing video frames, processing them, tracking a selected region, measuring EMI, and visualizing the results.
